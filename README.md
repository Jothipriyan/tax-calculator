The Tax Calculator project is a web-based application designed to assist users in determining their tax liabilities under both the old and new tax regimes in India. This interactive tool allows users to input their age, annual income, and various eligible deductions to calculate the taxable income and the corresponding taxes for both regimes. By providing a comparison between the old and new regimes, the application helps users decide which tax regime is more beneficial for their financial situation. The project combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality, making it a user-friendly and efficient solution for personal tax planning.
